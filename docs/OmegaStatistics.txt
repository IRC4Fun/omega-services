Omega Statistical Reporting
===========================

This module is designed to allow the development team
track the various versions in use across the IRC community.

At the present time we report the following items:

 * Name of the Omega server
 * Uplink/Uplinkname
 * Version
 * Protocol

This information is transmitted to our statistical gathering
host via HTTP POST. The information recorded is not available
to the public, but is used to generate statistics that are available
publically. We will never share the above information with any one
other then the development team.

If you would not like your copy of Omega to report statistical data
to us, you may disable it by passing --disable-omegastats to
configure.
